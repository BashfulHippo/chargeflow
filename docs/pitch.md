# ChargeFlow - 90 Second Pitch Script

## Opening (10 sec)
"Every night, 50,000 EVs in Lisbon plug in at the same time—7 PM. The grid strains. Prices spike. And ironically, all that 'clean' charging happens when the grid is dirtiest."

## Problem (15 sec)
"EV adoption is exploding, but our charging behavior is stuck in the gas station mindset—fill up now, pay whatever. This creates peak demand chaos, higher costs for everyone, and undermines Portugal's renewable energy goals."

## Solution (20 sec)
"ChargeFlow is smart charging for Lisbon. You plug in, tell us when you need your car, and we find the optimal hours to charge—when electricity is cheapest, the grid is cleanest, and demand is lowest. You save up to 40%, cut your carbon footprint by 15%, and help the city avoid €2 billion in grid upgrades."

## How It Works (15 sec)
"Our algorithm analyzes real-time Portuguese market prices, grid load data, and renewable energy forecasts. It builds a personalized charging schedule that respects your deadline while optimizing for cost, carbon, or both."

## Demo Highlight (15 sec)
"Let me show you: a Tesla Model 3 owner plugs in at 8 PM, needs 80% by 8 AM. ChargeFlow shifts their charging to 2-5 AM—saving €2.40 tonight, 420g of CO2, and reducing peak grid load."

## City Impact (10 sec)
"Now imagine 20,000 drivers using ChargeFlow. That's 12MW off peak demand, 1,200 tonnes of CO2 avoided annually—like planting 54,000 trees in Monsanto Park."

## Close (5 sec)
"ChargeFlow: Charge smarter. Save money. Clean up Lisbon's grid. One EV at a time."
